# About me and my coding beginnings :)
In high school I had to choose between my passion (playing on drums) or being an engineer, i wrote matura exam quite well but i decided to follow voice of my heart i being a professional drummer. For couples of years it was main job as well as being a waiter as a part-time job.
When Covid-19 came, i didn't had any concerts to play and restaurants was closed as well so i decided to practice more than ever end then my hand was injured. 
After lot of medical treatment and diagnosis from the doctor that i'll never be professional musican, being broken and exhausted i've decided finally to find job for some time, start learning programing, go to university and finally become an engineer.
Now i'm learning programing and trying to get my first job in IT.
